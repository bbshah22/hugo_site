## hello!

this website was created using hugo, the theme is based on hugo-coder, and it is hosted on github pages

(i know the title is very cheesy i will try to come up with a better one maybe haha)

I have never been one to create content for/about myself. It's always been projects for school or helping family members or the one of craft. One thing I have noticed though, is that I like documenting important moments and interesting thoughts that I have, whether that is in a journal or in my notes app. As, I thought that it would be cool to put the things that I care about all in one place. So here it is.

On this website you can see what projects I have worked on in the past, and what I am currently working on. Along with topics, tv shows, and podcasts I enjoy.

Feel free to reach me at the links on the home page!
