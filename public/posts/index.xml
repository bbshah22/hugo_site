      <description>hello! this website was created using hugo, the theme is based on hugo-coder, and it is hosted on github pages
(i know the title is very cheesy i will try to come up with a better one maybe haha)
I have never been one to create content for/about myself. It&amp;rsquo;s always been projects for school or helping family members or the one of craft. One thing I have noticed though, is that I like documenting important moments and interesting thoughts that I have, whether that is in a journal or in my notes app.</description>
